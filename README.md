# q2netcdf manipulates [Rockland Scientific's](https://rocklandscientific.com) Q-files as generated by [ISDP](https://rocklandscientific.com/news/rockland-data-logger/)

- `q2netcdf.py` translates a Q-file into a mostly CF compliant NetCDF file
- `dumpQHeader.py` dumps the initial header record of a Q-file
- `mergeqfiles.py` merges Q-files together. This is designed to be run on the glider as `/usr/local/bin/mergeqfiles`
- `mkISDPcfg.py` generates syntatically correct `isdp.cfg` files. It is designed to be run on the MR

## Installation

The command line scripts in this package may be installed using 
[pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) after cloning this repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OSUGliders/q2netcdf
cd q2netcdf
python3 -m pipx install .
```

`pipx` will install in a pipxy fashion:
- `q2netcdf`
- `dumpQHeader`
- `mergeqfiles`
- `mkISDPcfg`
`
If you don't trust `pipx` you can also directly run the scripts from the src/q2netcdf directory.
